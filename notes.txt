About:
Pokémon is a Japanese game that is international. It was created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori. The original
concept was thought of in 1996 and Pokémon were originally called Pocket Monsters, Red and Green.
The franchise has spanned all boaders, and from cards to computers, hand helds, and now played on the phone. There
are many Pokémon to catch, about 800 in total with new monsters added with every update. The term "Gotta Catch
'Em All" is a an English slogan that was coined in the United States.
By the way this is Pokémon text or what we like to call font!
If you want an in depth Pokémon history please go to Wikipedia.
